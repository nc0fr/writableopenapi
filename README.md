# writableopenapi

The [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) specification is a great way to 
describe HTTP APIs. However it is tedious to write and maintain a specification
in a data format such as YAML or JSON.
Therefore, this project aims to provide a way to write OpenAPI specifications 
in a concise a simple way using Python, as it is a very expressive yet flexible 
programming language.
